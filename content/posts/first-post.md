- David was an apache helicopter pilot
- turned Columbia CS
- And when I met him, we were sitting in a small conference room in a non-descript office building in Portland ME
- He was in charge of IT for a PE firm, that focused on acquiring a portfolio of small, profitable businesses with the intent to never sell
- They hadn't vertically integrated, but were strategically buying landscaping companies across a broad geo
- This isn't proprietary - they talked about it in the NYT. Twice.
- The business strategy was sound, but the part of the organization's philosophy that has stayed with me is this:
- David's framework for the strength of an organizations information systems
- Threat, Neutral, Competitive Advantage
- Organizations have a digital health
- it exists even if it's not deliberate
- their systems quality, integrity, integration into business process exist on a spectrum from threat to advantage
- Most organizations start at a threat level, and never emerge
- a threat means that the way you store, manage, or retrieve your data is compromising your ability to act in the marketplace
- Holly hired a petting zoo for her preschool, and the guy showed up at the end of his party because the calendar on his phone didn't save the appointment.
- He lost money because his technology wasn't helping him
- This is frequently true for large organizations, even apparently technical ones
- Beckman is so big that they bid against other parts of the organization for linkedin ad placements, driving up the cost of their own ads
- Most commonly this manifests itself in poor data centered decision making
- What is our average customer acquisition cost?
- What is our most profitable product?
- What does our best customer look like?
- What should I do next?
- HOW DO I MOVE OUT OF THE THREAT ZONE??
- Neutral
- Your digital position is no longer hurting your business, but it's not helping either
- In this situation, it requires maintenance, but is mostly inviduaul
- 
- Competitive Advantage
- 
- The skews right - the tail is in the advantage
- Fortune 500 assessment of digital strength from Cardinal Path is proof
